# BoxBuddy
An unofficial GUI for managing your Distroboxes. Written with GTK4 + Libadwaita.

Note that this does not come with Podman or Distrobox, those will need to be installed on the host.

## Issues / Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome! Please check the [roadmap](https://github.com/Dvlv/BoxBuddyRS/blob/master/docs/ROADMAP.md) to see if a feature is already planned.

When filing issues, please keep in mind that BoxBuddy is just a GUI, and I am not a developer of Distrobox itself. Any issues with created boxes are probably better logged [upstream.](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/issues)
